 About This Repository

Welcome to my C Programming repository! This repository contains a collection of projects, exercises, and algorithms written in C. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore C or an experienced developer seeking well-structured solutions, you'll find a variety of code examples here.

Whatâ€™s Inside:
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, etc.
- **Algorithms:** A range of algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Projects:** Small and medium-sized projects that demonstrate practical applications of C.
- **Exercises:** Challenges to practice C concepts and improve problem-solving skills.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other interesting C code snippets and utilities.

Why C?
C is a foundational programming language, known for its efficiency and control over system resources. By exploring C, I aim to improve my understanding of low-level programming concepts, memory management, and performance optimization.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request!
